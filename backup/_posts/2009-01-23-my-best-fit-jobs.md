You Scored as **Accounting/Finance/Marketing**

Point 1: 平均无比

Point 2: 我选了那个这个表上不存在的专业

Point 3: 我正在实习的那个公司也不在这个表里面

Point 4: 唯一值得庆祝的是我最喜欢的那个领域在waiting list里面，不知道我在不在她的里面

You should strongly consider majoring (or minoring) in Accounting, Finance, Economics, Marketing, or related majors (e.g., **Computer/Management Information Systems (CIS or MIS )**, Entrepreneurship, International Business, Operations Management, Public Administration, Real Estate, Risk Management, **Sports Management**).

<!--more-->

It is possible that the best major for you is your 2nd, 3rd, or even 5th listed category, so be sure to consider ALL majors in your OTHER high scoring categories (below). You may score high in a category you didnt think you would--it is possible that a great major for you is something you once dismissed as not for you.

The right major for you will be something 1) you love and enjoy and 2) are really great at it .

Consider adding a minor or double majoring to make yourself standout and to combine your interests. Please post your results in your myspace/blog/journal.
